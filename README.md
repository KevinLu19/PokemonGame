## Purpose
Inspired by the kids TV series Pokemon where there would be a random silhouette Pokemon that is used as a transition to the next scene of the TV series.

The main reason for this project is to put the knowledge of Flask into use by making a Pokemon guessing game. 

# Welcome To My Version of Who's That Pokemon
This is a standalone game taken from the Pokemon animated series "Who's That Pokemon" that was popular during our youth days.

NOTE: This guessing game will only have Pokemon from generation 1 - 3. Any Pokemon after that would not be here.

## How to play (WIP)
When given a picture of the Pokemon, the goal is to enter in the Pokemon's correct name.

### Installing

The fastest way to install is installing through requirement.txt
