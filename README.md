# Welcome To My Version of Who's That Pokemon
This is a standalone game taken from the Pokemon animated series "Who's That Pokemon" that was popular during our youth days.

NOTE: This guessing game will only have Pokemon from generation 1 - 3. Any Pokemon after that would not be here.

This project utilizes Python, Flask (framework), HTML, a miniscule of JavaScript, and CSS 

## How to play (WIP not near completion at all)
The game is currently being hosted on PythonAnyWhere. Link to the game: http://rumii7.pythonanywhere.com/

Very simple actually, there will be a random silhouette picture of a pokemon and the player's goal is to guess the name of the pokemon. Each correctly guessed Pokemon would reward player a point on the score board. Any incorrect guess would simply skip the current image pokemon.

## Work Priority 
* Focusing on deploying the game without silhouette. Along with working score board.
* Porting all platforms. 
* Add other generations to the game. Currently the system only have 1st generation Pokemon.
